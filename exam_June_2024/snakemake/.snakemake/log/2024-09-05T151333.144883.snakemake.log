MissingOutputException in rule phastCons in file /vsc-hard-mounts/leuven-data/362/vsc36251/exam_June_2024/snakemake/Snakefile, line 110:
Job 8  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
060.phastCons/phastcons.txt
Removing output files of failed job phastCons since they might be corrupted:
060.phastCons/snps.phastcons.vcf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
