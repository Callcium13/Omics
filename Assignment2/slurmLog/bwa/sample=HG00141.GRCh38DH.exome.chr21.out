Building DAG of jobs...
Falling back to greedy scheduler because no default solver is found for pulp (you have to install either coincbc or glpk).
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Provided resources: mem_mb=1000, mem_mib=954, disk_mb=1000, disk_mib=954
Select jobs to execute...
