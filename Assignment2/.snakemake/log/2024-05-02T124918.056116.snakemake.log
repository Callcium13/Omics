NameError: The name "'|'" is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        # Extract SNPs associated with specific patterns from the annotated VCF file
        grep "^#" {input.vcf} > {output.genes_vcf}  # Copy header lines to new file

        grep -E '{'|'.join(params.snp_patterns)}' {input.vcf} >> {output.genes_vcf}  # Append lines containing the specified patterns to new file
